			The process for donating blood is safe and easy. The total time you'll spend in the blood center is approximately an hour, but the blood donation itself only takes about 10 minutes. Simply fill out a questionnaire, undergo a quick physical, provide your donation, and take a few minutes to relax and eat snacks. Your body replaces the lost fluid within hours, while your red blood cells and iron take four and eight weeks to bounce back, respectively.<br/>
			If you decide to make a blood donation, you can choose to participate at a local blood drive, or you can opt to donate at a local blood center. You can prepare for your donation by eating iron-rich foods the day before and drinking plenty of water the day of your donation.
